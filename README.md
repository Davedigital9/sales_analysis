**Project Description**:
Sales Data Analysis with Python

**Overview**:
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of sales data using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. It includes two main visualizations:
-_Total Sales per Product Line_:
Utilizes the 'Product line' column to group and calculate total sales.
Presents the results in a bar chart, providing insights into product performance.

-__Monthly Sales Trends:
Resamples the sales data by month to analyze trends over time.
Plots monthly sales to identify patterns and variations.

**Dataset**:
The analysis is based on a sales dataset containing information about invoices, branches, cities, customer types, genders, product lines, unit prices, quantities, taxes, total amounts, dates, times, payment methods, costs of goods sold (cogs), gross margin percentages, gross incomes, and ratings.

**Instructions**:
Load your sales dataset by updating the 'file_path' variable.
Run the script to generate visualizations.

**Dependencies**:
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib

Feel free to explore, modify, and adapt the code for your specific use case.
